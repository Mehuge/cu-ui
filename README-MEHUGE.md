Mehuge UI
=========

Some of the modules in this UI require my cu-rest API.  There are two ways to obtain this.  The easiest is to clone the repo as a subfolder of this one:

  git clone https://github.com/Mehuge/cu-rest

The second way is to create a cu-rest folder, and then save a copy of cu-rest.js, cu-rest.map and cu-rest.ts into it.
